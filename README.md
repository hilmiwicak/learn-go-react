# learn-go-react
This is a learning repository of me learning golang and react. I'm using this Udemy course titled "Working with React and Go (Golang)". The course is basically about making a web app about movies. It gives a pretty great explanation about react for beginners, but unfortunately you need to have some level of understanding about Golang.
